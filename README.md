# About me 
My name is **Mustafa Al-ameen**. A law student and a  ~~data analyst~~ Frontend Engineer. My stack includes ***HTML***, ***CSS*** and ***Javascipt***. I love bring websites designs to life and make them responsive as they should. My daily life start with the blissful `<header></header>` and ends with the graceful`<footer></footer>` with meaningful `<section></section>`s within it.
