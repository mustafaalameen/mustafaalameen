# About me 
My name is **Mustafa Al-ameen**. A law student and a  ~~data analyst~~ Frontend Engineer. My stack includes ***HTML***, ***CSS***, and *** Javascript ***. I love  bringing website designs to life and making them responsive as they should be. My daily life starts with the blissful `<header></header>` and ends with the graceful`<footer></footer>` with meaningful `<section></section>`s within it.
